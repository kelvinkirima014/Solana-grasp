### Learn How to create a solana program from scratch to deployment.

- Solana could do better with more tutorials out there.

- It's an awesome blockchain that tackles Buterin's trillema - scalabilty, decentralization, and security brilliantly.

- This tutorial will help you understand the different implementations that solve this trillemma and how they all fit together.

- We'll also go on and install Rust and the Solana CLI so that we can build our first solana program.

#### Who's this tutorial for?

- Anyone with some basic programming skills can learn from this lesson. You also need to be able to use the CLI.

- Interest in blockchain and cryto.

### Technologies used in the Tutorial.

 - Blockchain architecture - you'll learn about consensus protocols, cryptography and governance.

 - Rust- solana programs are built using Rust language.
 
 - React - we'll create a frontend to interact with our program.

 ### Why take this course?

Solana has a steep learning curve compared to ethereum. A major reason for this is beacause of the scarcity of learning resources. I hope in making this tutorial, 

I'll help a few developers get on board and start  building on solana. 

I have started sharing my solana journey on [my blog](https://kirima.vercel.app/) and would love to see more guys learn a thing or two.
